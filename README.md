# Estimating engagement during lectures
group project created for the subject: competence project

The application allows you to calculate interest in a lecture based on detected emotions, and based on the lecturer's way of speaking.
We used algorithm to calculate interest from this document: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1632035

L = W x I

L - level of interest

W - weight of emotion

I - intensity of emotion

## How to run?
